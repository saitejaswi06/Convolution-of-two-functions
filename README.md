# ‚ûï Convolution of Two Functions using MATLAB

> A MATLAB-based implementation to visualize and compute the convolution of two time-domain functions, demonstrating the principles of **signal processing** and **systems analysis**.

## üéØ Objective

To perform and visualize the convolution of two continuous/discrete-time functions using MATLAB‚Äôs built-in and manual convolution methods. This project serves as an educational demonstration of how convolution integrates two signals to produce a third signal representing their combined effect.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

- Defined two functions (e.g., rectangular pulse, exponential decay) over a common time vector.
- Used MATLAB's `conv()` to compute discrete convolution and verified it against manually computed results.
- Visualized the **shifting, flipping, and integration process** of convolution using animated plots.
- Simulated time-domain convolution over a defined time range to observe overlap and area calculations.
- Improved clarity by adding axis labels, legends, and real-time stepwise visualization.

## üî¨ Key Takeaways

- Understood the mathematical concept of convolution and its practical significance in systems analysis.
- Visualized the **sliding window mechanism** that computes the overlap integral.
- Compared manual and built-in convolution results to validate implementation.

## üîó Example Output

- Graphs showing the two original signals.
- Step-by-step visualization of one function sliding over another.
- Final convolution output plotted over time.
